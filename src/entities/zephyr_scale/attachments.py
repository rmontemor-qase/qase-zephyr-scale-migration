    """Attachment handling for Zephyr Scale.

    Zephyr Scale Cloud does not expose a bulk attachment download API for external
    clients. Attachments linked to test cases are accessible only through the
    Zephyr Scale UI or via Jira attachments. The actual upload/link of attachments
    happens during case import when the Qase API supports it.

    This class is kept as a no-op stub consistent with other migration scripts so
    the Importer can call it unconditionally.
